# AdventOfCode2017-on-CP-M-80

Here is my solutions for the adventofcode 2017 on CP/M 80.
The objective is to prove that most of the challenges can be done on a Z80 computer with 64 KB of RAM, which can be sometimes 1000000 slower than a modern PC (eg with double precision calculations)...
I tried to do all the challenges with Turbo Modula-2 for CP/M 80, an excellent development environment written by Martin Odersky, and sometimes the language really shines !
